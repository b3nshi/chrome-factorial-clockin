# Factorial Clock-In Autofill

It is a simple Chrome extension developed to autofill the clock-in option in Factorial.

> Note: This is not an official tool. It does not get access to any sensitive data, and you can always check the code and import it manually in Chrome.

### Features

- Definition of multiple ranges
- Ignore weekends
- Ignore "Holidays"

### How to install it?

1. Go to chrome://extensions and enable `developer mode` (the option should be located in the top-right corner)
2. Click on `Load unpacked`
3. Select the folder `src` with the code
4. Enjoy!

> I don't see any real benefit in building the code since it is an extension meant to be installed manually at the moment, so you can download this folder and use it as-is.

### How to build the extension

1. Run `npm install`
2. Run `npm build`
3. Use the `dist` folder to import the plugin
